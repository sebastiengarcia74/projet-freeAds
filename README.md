# projet-freeAds

a leboncoin-like project, in 1 week in a team of 4. Laravel and mysql. 
The goal was to be able to display, create, delete and edit your ads as a user (with an auth, that i took care of), and of course as an admin for all ads.
Each ads was supposed to have a picture and a category.
